# streamlit-widget-url-sync

Adds some additional functionality to streamlit_widgets via monkey-patching, which
allows a user to add `url_sync=True` to any streamlit widget, and have it automatically
do a two-way sync with the url. This means that it's much easier to share the
widget in a specific state (e.g. these checkboxes checked, that item selected from the
selector, etc.)
